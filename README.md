#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of making quality sofwtare systems, using the tools,methods and principles of software engineering. It plays an important role in the technology industry because it makes it easier for people to commuincate and access information that they might need. It helps with finding out importanty information on time without doing too much work.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages like python, java and javascript which are the languages we use to write codes that dvelop into our sofwtares when we done. 
The establisment of software engineering as a dicipline which is a discpline or an cademic that we use to learn about making softwares.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, I would say the rules and regualtions that we should followe when writing a code of r the software

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Designing: Designing is coming up with an idea of the software that you want to make and how you want it to work and look like.
Development: Development is actually the stage in which you make that sofwtare, you write the code for the software so that it can work.
Testing: Testing, you check if everything is working well and if it does not you fix it.
Deployment: You are distributing your software to the public so that can see and use it.
Maintanance: You are making sure that your sofwtare develops as time changes and it stays with the changes that are happening in the world basically you are making newer versions or new things for the public to continue liking it or using it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall I would say it is the methodology you use in the first stages of software developemnt like designing the app and developing it. 
Agile I would it is a stage when the software now works and it need sto be maintained and you use this method to do that, It is the stage of deployment, seeing how users and dealers react to it. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible to write the code and deal with the problems of the code and come up with solutions.
Quality assurance Engineer makes sure that the designs of the software is what they envisioned and to test it and make sure that it works  well.
Project mananger makes sure that the evrything is going well with the development of the software and makes plans to distribute the software.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines, it may cost the team to dvelop sofwtare that are not purely tested and not working well. They need to commuinicate with their partners about this and set the deadlines and put on some etxra time of their own so that they can make a good job.
Changing requirements, Users may wnat different versions or different things that they have seen from other apps so to deal with that they must paln ahead and create some of the things ahead of time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit, You are testing individual components one by one to check if they work individually before making them work with other components. 
Intergration, Testing different components it amy be if they are working together.
Acceptance, Testing if the software works on the user's side. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting good questions and instructions so that the AI can give you a specific information that you want. It is really importance becaus eit makes it easier for AI to give you what you want if you have writtent it concise. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How can I make a sandwich that I am trying to make right now. 
I am making peanut butter sandwhich and I want to know how can I make it. This one is improved because the AI knows what kind of sandwhich you want to make and its going to provide you with the answers for that specific peanut butter sandwhich.
